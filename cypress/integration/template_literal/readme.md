# Template literals

This is a super round about way of using a template literal in cy.get, if you're just interested in template literals then take a look straight in the spec.

If you're interested in the particular usecase of having to import a testid from another location that you have no control over AND the testid in question is broken in some way then take a look at the utility function and fixture to see how you can edit a string at the tests end to get around the broken value you cant control.
